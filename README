here are a few projects that i'm simply putting here because i can.  the docs are in the comments mostly as they will usually be only a single file with a single class in it.

the liscence for all these fun things are as follows:

you have the privlidge, nay, the _right_ to use, abuse, modify, disassemble, reassemble, compile, cross-compile, and generally poke-where-the-sun-dont-shine any and all code posted in _this_ spot, subject to the following requirements:

1) you are hearby _DISALLOWED_ from using my code - in whole or in part - from doing pure unadulterated evil.  semi-evil i can deal with.  kind-of-evil is ok.  only-evil-on-the-third-thursday-of-the-month is ok too.  i mean, we're all a little evil aren't we?  just no pure unadulterated evil.  cause that's just bad!

2) if you use my code, in whole or in part, to take over the world, you must grant me and whomever i choose an expansive plot of our very own land in new zealand.  this plot of land will be no smaller than 10 acres per person i choose & shall be located in an area agreed upon by both parties.  also the land shall have no taxes liened against it, nor against anything upon it, only things exported from it may have taxes levied upon it and only if that is nessisary.  this property shall be part of my family line until we get fed up with your tyrant ass and take over the world ourselves!  failure to do so shall force me to code super bad-ass ninja warriors from the future to go and kick _your_ ass!

questions, comments & concerns shall be filed in triplicate to serialhex [at] gmail <dot> com, his secretary, and his personal assistant.  if you fail to do this there is a _great_ likelyhood that your email will be lost in the ginormus inbox that is serialhex's

thank you all and good night!
